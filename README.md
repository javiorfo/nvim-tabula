# nvim-dbeer
*Minimal Multi database client for Neovim*

## Caveats
- These dependencies are required to be installed: `Go v1.23.2`, `unixodbc`. 
- For the sake of simplicity, **this plugin is STATELESS**. It does not use database sessions or keep states after Neovim is closed.
- This plugin has been developed on and for `Linux` following open source philosophy.

## Configuration
#### Configure DB connections and credentials
- In the `setup` show above there is a section left out to be configured by the user (**connections** inside **db** table).
- Here are some examples of different DB configurations
- Engines possible values are: "db2", "mongo", "postgres", "oracle", "mysql", "mssql" and "informix".
`Lazy`
```lua
opts = {
    db = {
        -- Here when open a sql file (or js file in Mongo case) connection will set to 2nd element (postgres)
        default = 2,
        
        -- Required fields are:
        -- name, engine and dbname
        -- host and port will be the default in each engine if not set
        -- user and password are optional
        connections = {
            {
                name = "MongoDB some name",
                engine = "mongo",
                host = "123.4.1.8",
                port = "27016",
                dbname = "db_dummy",
                user = "admin",
                password = "admin",
            },
            {
                name = "PostgreSQL example",
                engine = "postgres",
                dbname = "db_dummy",
                user = "admin",
                password = "admin",
            },
            {
                name = "Oracle example",
                engine = "oracle",
                dbname = "db_dummy",
                user = "admin",
                password = "admin",
            },
            {
                name = "MS-SQL 1",
                engine = "mssql",
                dbname = "db_dummy",
            },
            {
                name = "MySQL something",
                engine = "mysql", -- "mysql" also works for MariaDB 
                dbname = "db_dummy",
                user = "admin",
                password = "admin",
            },
            -- IBM Informix needs ODBC connection configured (check unix ODBC docs for this)
            {
                name = "Informix_ODBC", -- 'name' must match your DSN
                engine = "informix",
                dbname = "odbc" -- 'dbname' must be "odbc"
            },
            -- IBM DB2 needs ODBC connection configured (check unix ODBC docs for this)
            {
                name = "DB2_ODBC", -- 'name' must match your DSN
                engine = "db2",
                dbname = "odbc" -- 'dbname' must be "odbc"
            },
        }
    }
}
```

- I personally recommend having connections in the same folder where the sql or js scripts are stored. So you can check or set connections in the same folder you have database scripts.
`Lazy`
```lua
opts = {
    db = dofile(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/path/to/connections.lua")

    -- connections.lua will have something like
    -- return {
    --     default = 1,
    --     connections = {
    --         {...} -- here complete the connection data
    --     }
    -- }
}
```

    - [ ] Select statements
- [x] Command to list tables
- [x] Command to get table info (fields, pk, fk, data type, etc)

##### Example
```javascript
db.mycollection.find({ "field1": "value1" }).sort({"info": -1})

// "db." is optional in nvim-dbeer. This will work too
mycollection.find({ "field1": "value1" }).sort({"info": -1})
```

## Usage
- When a **sql file** or **js file** (in case of Mongo) is opened, Neovim will print what connection is set by default in nvim-dbeer. The connection to the database is done when the query is executed (open connection, execute statement, close connection), no session is set.
- The keymap `<C-t>` (could be modified by the user, see config above) if executed in **NORMAL mode** will take all the script (semicolon-separated) to process. But maybe it's best to execute it in **VISUAL mode** getting the same experience of a stardard DB IDE where a query can be selected and execute it in isolation instead of the entire script.

---

## Commands
### DBeerBuild
- This is executed when this plugin receives and update, not necessary to be executed manually except if nvim-dbeer informs it.

### DBeerLogs
- Show the logs

### DBeerDB
- Command to change the DB connection to another one.
- Show a expanded info of the DB (name, engine, host, port, credentials)

### DBeerTables
- This command uses telescope.nvim showing all the tables of the selected database
- If you press enter after a table was selected, a popup show the "selected table" info

## Logs
Logs are saved generally in this path: **/home/your_user/.local/state/nvim/dbeer.log**

- To check the logs execute the command `:dbeerLogs`

**NOTE**: Only error logs are saved. If you want to enable debug phase, enable this on setup configuration:
```lua
require'dbeer'.setup {
    internal = {
       log_debug = true 
   }
}
```

## Screenshots
#### Example executing the entire script (not select allowed) semicolon-separated
- Note that in the fourth statement there is a duplicated primary key error reported
